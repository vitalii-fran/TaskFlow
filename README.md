## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture
The architecture of TaskFlow is composed of the following components:

### Frontend
- **React**: Used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **AWS Amplify**: Deployed on AWS Amplify for scalable and secure hosting.
- **Interaction**: Communicates with the backend via **API Gateway**.

### Backend
- **AWS Lambda**: Implements serverless backend logic, handling incoming API requests.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Routes requests to Lambda and manages API lifecycle.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Serves as the primary database for storing and retrieving application data.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the build, test, and deployment phases.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Compiles, tests, and packages the application.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Collects and monitors metrics and logs, with custom dashboards and alerts for proactive monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps for Project Implementation

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Start by creating a new repository on GitHub and initialize it with a `README.md` file.

2. **Backend Development**
   - Implement REST API using **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
   - Configure **DynamoDB** for data storage.

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Build the UI using **React**.
   - Integrate with the backend through **API Gateway**.
   - Deploy using **AWS Amplify**.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Set up **AWS CodePipeline** to automate the build and deployment process.
   - Use **AWS CodeBuild** for the build phase.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Configure **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor application performance and logs.
   - Set up dashboards and alerts.

6. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test the entire application stack.
   - Ensure security best practices using IAM and backups.
